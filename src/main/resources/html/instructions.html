<h3>Instructions for Use</h3>
<p>
    The interface and menus should be pretty self-explanatory, so they'll just be covered here in light detail.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The <em>File</em> menu contains options for creating a new model, saving, loading or exporting a model, and finally an option to quit the program.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <em>Edit</em> menu contains options for making changes to the current model, such as adding or removing relations and attributes, or undoing/redoing actions.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <em>Help</em> menu contains some items with additional information about the application, like this help page and a simple <em>About</em> popup with version information. There's also a <em>Load Sample Model</em> option, which will load a very basic sample model into the application that you are free to mess around with.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The main focus of the application is the <em>Diagram Panel</em> where all of the editing actually takes place. This is where any relations you create, or attributes you create, appear; this is what is rendered when you select the option to export your model to an image.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Click on a relation to select it.
    </li>
    <li>
        CTRL+Click to select multiple relations at once.
    </li>
    <li>
        Drag relations to move them around the workspace.
    </li>
    <li>
        Right-click on different areas to access a context menu with some helpful actions.
    </li>
    <li>
        Hold <em>Shift</em> while dragging the mouse to pan across the model. To reset panning, press <em>Shift + Space</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Press <em>Control + Space</em> to move the view so that the diagram is centered.
    </li>
    <li>
        When exporting the model to an image, be sure to add the desired image file extension (.png, .jpg, .bmp, etc.), or the application will default to .png.
    </li>
</ul>
